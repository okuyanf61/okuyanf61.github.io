I was born in Samsun in 1997. I completed primary and high school education in 4 different cities and 8 different schools. I am currently a student at Mugla Sitki Kocman University Computer Engineering Department. My goal is to be a successful Computer Engineer. I like to listen musics, swim, ride bikes and develop apps.

This blog contains Linux, Android, Java, Python etc. I will try to write them about as far as I know about them.
