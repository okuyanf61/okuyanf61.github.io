PwLock is an easy-to-use, powerful password generator and manager.

Annoyed of forgetting your passwords?

Do you want a secure way of storing and organizing all your passwords instead of writing them down on a sheet of paper?

PwLock is the best solution for you!

PwLock stores and manages all your entered data in an encrypted way, so you have a secure storage of your passwords and you only have to remember your master-password. This password manager allows you to manage all your passwords, which are stored completely encrypted and safe. The encryption which is used for protecting your data vault in PwLock is based on the strong Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128bit and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 512bit.

You can trust PwLock 100% as it does not have any access to the internet.

Note, the password manager is totally offline, so it has NO connection to internet, because of the missing internet-permissions.
